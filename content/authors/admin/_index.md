I'm a Biophysics PhD Canidate in the [Aksimentiev Group] (http://bionano.physics.illinois.edu/) at UIUC.
I develop technologies at the interface of nanotech and biology using large-scale simulations.
My research focuses on developing sequencing methods to control DNA transport to nanopores and through nanopores in [2D](http://bionano.physics.illinois.edu/node/147) and [solid-state](http://bionano.physics.illinois.edu/node/160) materials to minimize error during base-readout.
Recently, I've become interested in machine/deep learning methods, particularly related to computer vision and also applications of blockchain.
