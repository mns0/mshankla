I combine physics, statistics, and machine learning to craft stories from ensembles of data. 

Along the way, I've [guided DNA on graphene nano-highways](http://bionano.physics.illinois.edu/node/302) featured in [Nature Nanotechnology](https://www.nature.com/nnano/volumes/14/issues/9) and [flossed DNA through graphene pores](http://bionano.physics.illinois.edu/node/147) featured in [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6171).
